04/11/2025, 13:11 - Dr. Trupti Deshmukh: A complete graph is a special type of graph where each vertex is connected to every other vertex by unique edge. So if there are n vertices degree of vertex is n-1.


Regular graph means all vertices are have the same degree but not necessarily connected to all other vertices. Example is: square (each vertex connects to exactly 2 others ,but not to all 3 others so it's not complete but regular graph)
